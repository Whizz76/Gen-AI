# Gen-AI
## What is Gen-AI
It is a field of AI that offers to create original content based on pattern-recognition. From creating written texts, musical sounds, visual effects it can do anything
with the help of instructions given to it. For e.g 
1. DALL-E --> develops visuals based on text 
2. ChatGpt --> creates human like responses to every question asked.

## Technical terms explained:
1. Perceptron: An early type of neural network component that can decide whether or not an input, represented by numerical values, belongs to a specific class.

2. Neural Networks: Computer systems modeled after the human brain that can learn from data by adjusting the connections between artificial neurons.

3. Back Propagation: A method used in artificial neural networks to improve the model by adjusting the weights by calculating the gradient of the loss function.

4. Statistical Machine Learning: A method of data analysis that automates analytical model building using algorithms that learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

5. Deep Learning: A subset of machine learning composed of algorithms that permit software to train itself to perform tasks by exposing multilayered neural networks to vast amounts of data.

6. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): A class of machine learning models where two networks, a generator and a discriminator, are trained simultaneously in a zero-sum game framework.

7. Transformer: A type of deep learning model that handles sequential data and is particularly noted for its high performance in natural language processing tasks.
